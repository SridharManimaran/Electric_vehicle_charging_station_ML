# Electric_vehicle_charging_station_ML
The data on all charging stations present in the UK were retrieved from gov.uk website, data wrangling was performed using excel removing the unnecessary data. The next step was carried out with SQLite to extract the inactive charging stations in London and Motorway (M25). Visualization of Ac and DC charging stations performed using qGIS where a heat map created to not only visualize but to measure the proximity between stations. Exploratory data analysis performed with R programming, further process was carried out with supervised machine learning, the two methods predominantly used were decision tree and random forest.
